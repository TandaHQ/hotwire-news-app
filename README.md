# README

## Getting Started
1. Fork this repository to create a copy in your personal GitHub account
2. Add 'gitpod.io#' to the beginning of your repo's URL (example: gitpod.io/#https:/github.com/username/hotwire-news-app). This will clone your forked repo into GitPod, where you can start developing
3. Open port 3000 in your browser (look for Port options in left sidebar)
4. You'll likely encounter a Blocked Host message when your app first opens in the browser. Grab the code listed there and paste it in your config/environments/development.rb file. Save the changes, restart your server, then refresh your browser (run Ctrl+C to quit server then rails server to start it again)

If you want to push changes to your forked repo, enable the 'public_repo' permission setting for GitHub via https://gitpod.io/integrations
